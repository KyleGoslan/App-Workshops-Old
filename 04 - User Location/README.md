####Summary
Last session we had a brief overview of working with `CLLocation` and `CLGeocoder` objects. We also created `MKAnnotation` objects (the pins on our map) and explored some of the simple thinks we can do with out map view. 

This week we'll look at how we can get a users location and the basic things we need to understand about how it works. We also need to ask permission for our application to use location information for the device.
