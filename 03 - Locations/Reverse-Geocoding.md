####Summary
This will be an introduction to some of the classes/objects that can help us work with location based information in iOS. When dealing with location on modern devices we usually get location information back in the form of latitude and longitude values (lat/long for short). For example, the location of Weymouth House is 50.742766, -1.894778 (you can find lat/long for any location by clicking somewhere on Google Maps).
